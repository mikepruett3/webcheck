# WebCheck Scripts

These scripts were originally created for the Hallucinine ARG, back in 2009.
The goal of these scripts was to check when particular url's changed, and alert the players of so.

# Running the scripts

You can run the WebCheck.ps1 or WebCheckv2.ps1 scripts from a PowerShell console.

NOTE - You will need to update the websites.txt file with the url's to check.

# Database Creation Script

Use the included websites.sql script to create a Database Table to store results. (Used with WebCheckv2)
